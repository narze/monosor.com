# Review - Obsidian

[Obsidian][0] is the latest note taking app I'm using. After moving from Evernote and Notion, I ended up with Obsidian which is decent in many ways.

## Markdown

I love Markdown! I write document with Markdown a lot. It can have links, formatting, others many [features][1], and works with various websites & apps.

## Linking

This is the killing feature of Obsidian you can add links to other notes easily with `[[...]]` and you can see all the connections in the Graph View. You can create your own knowledge management system from your notes.

## Fast & Secure

Editing in Obsidian is fast & intuitive since it supports using local file, so you can use it with any cloud file services like Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. (I use [Syncthing][2] with every Macs I have & a NAS)

## Simple Structure

The note structure is simple, but you can do almost everything with them. Like grouping them into folders, or add tags to each notes. I'm trying to organize it with [PARA system][3] which I will explain later when I have more notes.
