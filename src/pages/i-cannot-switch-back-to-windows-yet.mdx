# I cannot switch back to Windows...yet

I've been using macOS for coding for many years. I know that Windows are getting better than ever, since they have the powerful WSL2 which cover most of my workflow. But still, the Apple ecosystem and all the apps I use daily keep me from switching back to Windows. Here are the list of some apps I believe that they have no alternative apps on Windows (or with some switching cost.)

- [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) - I can't live without this app.
- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) - Windows have [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com), but it is completely different and I think that KM is more user-friendly.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)
- [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) - Windows have [FancyZones](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/wiki/FancyZones-Overview) which looks promising.
- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) - Offline API Doc browser
- [Time Out](https://www.dejal.com/timeout) - Pomodoro-like timer app whick can block screen on breaks.
- [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) - Best GTD app ever. (They don't do Windows apps.)
- And some more on [Setapp bundle](https://setapp.com)
