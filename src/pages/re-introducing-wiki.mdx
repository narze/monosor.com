# Re-introducing Wiki

Before the making of this [Digital Garden][1]. I build my [personal wiki][2], but I have not update it for quite some time.

## What are the differences?

In the wiki I planned to add links, code snippets, and short reads I discovered. They will be categorized into many fields as it grow. Some of them will be mentioned here for reference.

## Maintaining wiki

The wiki is [also on my GitHub][3]. I use [Obsidian][4] to update them and sync them with [Gitupdate][5]. This way I can make it easy to add stuffs and publish on [Gitbook][6].
