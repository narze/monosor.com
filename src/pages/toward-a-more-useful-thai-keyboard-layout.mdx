# Toward a more useful Thai keyboard layout

All of the Thai keyboard layouts are created in the typewriter era. I wanted to create a new one sometime ago since I moved from [Kedmanee][1] (Thai's QWERTY) to [Pattachote][2].
The problems of the two layouts is they're not optimized for modern keyboards, and even some of the characters are dead eg. `ฃ`, `ฅ`, `ฦ`, `๏`.
Moreover, Thai numbers are seldomly used in normal situations, hence forcing users to switch to English layout to type numbers or use the numpad.
Lastly, I want the layout I created to be keyboard form factor agnostic. I can use [40% Keyboard][3] with both Kedmanee & Pattachote, but still think that it can be better.

Apparently there is a new layout called [IKBAEB][4] which resonates all of the ideas, but I want to use modern Thai corpus as a dataset and then generate the layout somehow.
Maybe it will yield the same result, but this way I will have an excuse to learn [Rust][5].

For the name of the layout, I will use [my family name][6] for now.

## Plans

- Learn minimum Rust to process Thai language corpus.
- Generate n-grams from corpus.
- Create typing effort model from n-grams, similar to [Carpalx][7].
- Discover & measure new layout with lower effort from the model.
