# How I use tmux

I'm a fan of [tmux][1]. However, I hardly use `tmux` alone without these tools.

## [.tmux][2]

I good tmux config for starter. Easy to use, and powerful. Powerline is included.

## [Tmuxnator][3]

I don't like to detach and attach sessions or use [`tmux-resurrect`][4] / [`tmux-continuum`][5]. I like to start a project with the same set of commands every time. So I use [Tmuxinator][3] to manage sessions with Yaml-formatted config instead.

This is the sample config for Tmuxinator, which runs 3 instances of `yarn` at once.

```yaml
windows:
  - editor:
       layout: main-vertical
       panes:
         - 
         - yarn run e2e
         - yarn run test
   - server:
       layout: main-vertical
       panes: 
         - yarn run dev
```

## My Key Bindings

I didn't use `Ctrl-A` or `Ctrl-B` as prefix like other people. I rebind the prefix to `Ctrl-;` instead (It is `Ctrl-O` on [Colemak DHm][6]). Moreover, I use Ctrl + vim movement keys to switch windows & panes.

See my current config [here][7].
