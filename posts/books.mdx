# Books I've read

I like to read productivity-related (some are "self-help") books. Recently I started reading science fiction as well.
I often read on my [Onyx Boox Nova](https://www.boox.com/boox-nova/) using Kindle app or PDF reader app.

### [Relentless - Tim Grover](https://www.amazon.com/Relentless-Unstoppable-Tim-S-Grover/dp/1476714207)

Tim classifies people into 3 groups: Cooler, Closer, and Cleaner.
Then focus on what Cleaner thinks and does to achieve successful career, like Micheal Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Dwyane Wade for instance.
Alghouth I don't know much of NBA or basketball words like "Ring", or "Game Four" to it confuses me a little bit.
Overall this book inspired me to improve myself and be a Cleaner one day.

### [The Three-body Problem - Cixin Liu](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)>)

A chinese SF novel about (no-spoilers) Chinese history in time of [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution), an astrophysicist, a Virtual Reality game, and how they related to some weird phenomenon from unknown source.
The book is the first book of three-book trilogy in [Remembrance of Earth's Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past) which I have not read all of them yet.
